        <p>An open letter to my friends I met in the service industry,</p> </p> The last time I saw a lot of you I was stuck; in a cycle of fast cash, late nights, and blurred memories. I was packing up my whole life in Austin and taking a chance on something different. While I love and cherish each of the people I’ve worked with, partied with, laughed with and cried with over the years, in the end I was left feeling like my stint as a waitress had taken more from me than it gave.
            
             That being said, this past year has been a journey of rediscovery and I’d like to share some of the things that have helped me heal & remember what it is that I love about the industry. </p>
            
            </p>First, I’ve found myself in my love for cooking. Using all the skills I absorbed simply being in that environment to cook for myself and taking the time to make it beautiful and play with it has opened up the space for me to feel gratitude for the long shifts. The Mother’s Day doubles, private events and slow lunches. The times where I was pushed to the limit, mentally and physically and honestly felt like I would never feel happiness again. They don’t feel so scary when I can look back at them as times where I was learning another form of self expression; one that I can use to feed myself and my loved ones, for the rest of my life. This gratitude feels especially strong as we move into the holiday season, which has always been linked with family, love and food in my life. </p>
            
        </p>Second,
            chasing the curiosity, the itch I had to explore the ocean, has taught me so much about prioritizing taking care of me and finding a way to balance what I want out of my career with what I need for my happiness. The main component of that has been my time in coral restoration. The amount of skills I’ve picked up in the industry that translate to my job now continues to surprise me everyday. So if you’ve been in it for a while and feel like even if you wanted to, you could never get out I’m here to tell you that you can. Find something you’re curious about, that interests you or you find yourself thinking about often and chase the fuck out of it. We have the unique advantage of being able to do our job at any restaurant, in any city across the U.S. The industry will always be there to fall back on, so why not jump? I also found a way to feed the industry itch by bartending at a small, members only sailing club where they feed me every time I come and treat me like I’m a member of their family. The time I spend there has taught me that no amount of money is worth getting treated like you’re less than human. Ever. There are other jobs, other co-workers and other bosses and if a company doesn’t see your worth it’s not worth your peace to stay.</p>
            
        </p> The final piece for me has been learning to live in the daylight. Living in a world of late nights, late afternoon in-times and degrading experiences left me with a closet full of lace & glitter and a giant hole where my personality was supposed to be. I lost all my hobbies, my connection to nature, my spirituality and finally I lost my will to live. Existing became enough, getting through the next shift and to the next bar became enough and Tori, who I’d spent years discovering, became lost in the pain, anxiety, addiction and depression that came with that lifestyle. To heal from that I’ve been waking up early just to make myself breakfast and watch the sunrise. I get up with enough time to plan out an outfit for work that is an expression of myself and I spend the rest of the day feeling good because I’m not spending every hour the sun is up trapped in a uniform that’s takes all of me and stifles it behind the brand of whatever company is taking my time, happiness and sense of self-worth for $2.75 an hour.</p>
            
            If you’re feeling lost in the industry, or just needed a reminder that it doesn’t always have to suck I hope you read this, and I hope it helped.</p>
